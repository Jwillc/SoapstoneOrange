# What is Soapstone Orange?

Soapstone Orange is an app inspired by the Dark Souls "Soapstone" messaging system. Where players in the game can leave messages in the world for other players to see. These messages can be rated up or down. Messages can have many purposes such as to warn a player or to trick them and many other uses.

In the app users can leave soapstone like messages in the real world using the built in message builder similar to that in Dark Souls. Messages like "I did it!" on top of a mountain, or funny messages like "Resignation Ahead" while at work.

The app uses Google Maps API's and Firebase to store and sync data. 

# Why do I need an account?

In order to keep track of which messages belong to which users we require that users create an account. No information will be shared and it's completely okay for users to use fake credentials signing up. We do not require email varification. So user can use a fake email and password to use the app, although they should remember the login for signing back in later.

# Progress

The app is very early in open beta. I plan to add many more features and improve the existing one's as needed. Currently I am looking into adding a notification system for when one of the users messages gets rated they will be notified. Adding this feature and testing it is the primary focus at the moment. 

# Feedback 

Feedback is not only very much appreciated, it's a vital part making the app a success. If you have feedback or issues please share them here: https://github.com/Jwillc/SoapstoneOrange/issues
